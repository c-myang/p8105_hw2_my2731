## Problem 1: NYC Transit Data

We will work with NYC Transit data; which contains information related
to each entrance and exit for each subway station in NYC.

We will read in and clean the data by retaining line, station name,
station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance
type, and ADA compliance. We also want to convert the entry variable
from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable.

To achieve this, we will read in the dataset using `read_csv()`, convert
the variable names to snake case using `janitor::clean_names()`, use
`select()` to keep the variables of interest in our data, then use
`mutate() and recode()` to convert the `entry` from a character to a
logical variable.

``` r
transit_data = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE)) 

head(transit_data)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 19
    ##   line  stati…¹ stati…² stati…³ route1 route2 route3 route4 route5 route6 route7
    ##   <chr> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>

    ## 4 4 Av… 36th St    40.7   -74.0 N      R      <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>  
    ## 5 4 Av… 36th St    40.7   -74.0 N      R      <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>  
    ## 6 4 Av… 45th St    40.6   -74.0 R      <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>  
    ## # … with 8 more variables: route8 <dbl>, route9 <dbl>, route10 <dbl>,
    ## #   route11 <dbl>, entrance_type <chr>, entry <lgl>, vending <chr>, ada <lgl>,
    ## #   and abbreviated variable names ¹​station_name, ²​station_latitude,
    ## #   ³​station_longitude

Using `head(transit_data)`, we can see our cleaned data includes 19
observations and 1868 observations. For each station entrance/exit, we
have information about the station name, line, the station latitude and
longitude, the routes it serves, entrance type, whether it has an entry,
has a ticket vendor, and whether it is ADA compliant.

After these steps, these data are not fully tidy. We can see there are
several `route#` columns to indicate each individual subway route a
station serves, making our dataset very wide. Moreover, the `vending`
variable could also be converted to a logical variable, since it is a
binary variable (like `entry` and `ada`).
